Survivor Management for Kingdom Death
![Alt text](/Images/chad.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot")

## Kingdom Death
Kingdom Death is a game made by Adam Poots. Please support him at www.kingdomdeath.com

##Lantern Management
Lantern replicates the management of survivors through a graphical UI. People will be able to put this utility onto a usb and bring it to their game sessions. Survivors will be written into .lantern files (which are *suprise* just xml files). lantern files are movable and aimed for being able to be hosted on a server or passed around on usb sticks for your friends to trade and use freely during game sessions. 

## To-do
- [x] Create survivor management logic **(TESTING)**
- [ ] Create management logic (alive/dead list)
- [ ] Create settlement sheet logic
